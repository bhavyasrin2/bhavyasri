#Abstract
Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including stroke. Stroke, a serious medical condition caused by disruption of blood flow to the brain, is a major cause of mortality worldwide. The relationship between hypertension and stroke has been extensively studied, and evidence suggests that hypertension plays a significant role in the development and progression of stroke.
This literature review aims to provide an overview of the existing research on the detection of hypertension and its association with the risk of stroke. The review begins with an overview of hypertension, including its definition, risk factors, and prevalence. The diagnostic criteria and methods for detecting hypertension are discussed, including blood pressure measurement techniques.
The review then delves into the link between hypertension and stroke, examining the evidence from observational studies. The mechanisms underlying the relationship between hypertension and stroke are explored.
Furthermore, the review highlights the risk factors that contribute to the development of hypertension, including lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and stress, as well as genetic and environmental factors. The impact of hypertension treatment, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, on reducing the risk of stroke is also discussed. 
Lastly, the review concludes with recommendations for future research and interventions to improve hypertension detection and management to reduce the risk of stroke. Early detection and management of hypertension are critical in preventing stroke and its associated morbidity and mortality. Further research is needed to better understand the complex relationship between hypertension and stroke and to develop effective strategies for hypertension detection, prevention, and management to reduce the burden of stroke in the population.
